# MulleCurl

#### ðŸ¥Œ HTTP client library for the MulleFoundation based on libcurl

A library on top of the MulleFoundation.


Uses [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se) to GET and POST `NSData` from URLs.
It uses the **easy**  interface of libcurl. The curl library is compiled
for HTTP(S) only.

Written in and for [mulle-objc](//mulle-objc.github.io).

## Usage


This example fetches a text file and prints it out.

```
#import <MulleCurl/MulleCurl.h>

#include <stdio.h>

static NSString   *URL = @"https://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/weblog/2019/mulle_objc_0_16_release.html";


int  main( void)
{
   MulleCurl   *curl;
   NSURL           *url;
   NSData          *data;
   NSError         *error;

   curl = [[MulleCurl new] autorelease];
   [curl setOptions:@{
                       @"CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER": @(NO),
                       @"CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST": @(NO)
                     }];
   data = [curl dataWithContentsOfURLWithString:URL];
   if( ! data)
   {
      error = [NSError mulleCurrentErrorWithDomain:MulleCurlErrorDomain];
      fprintf( stderr, "%s\n", [[error description] UTF8String]);
      return( 1);
   }

   printf( "%.*s", (int) [data length], [data bytes]);
   return( 0);
}
```

Notable is the simple interface. Instead of `-dataWithContentsOfURL:error:` it
is just `-dataWithContentsOfURLWithString:`. You don't have to wrap the string
into an NSURL and the NSError can be retrieved later
if required.

[MulleWeb](/MulleWeb/MulleWeb) adds a `NSURL` interface for convenience.


## Build

This is a [mulle-sde](https://mulle-sde.github.io/) project.

It has it's own virtual environment, that will be automatically setup for you
once you enter it with:

```
mulle-sde MulleCurl
```

Now you can let **mulle-sde** fetch the required dependencies and build the
project for you:

```
mulle-sde craft
```
